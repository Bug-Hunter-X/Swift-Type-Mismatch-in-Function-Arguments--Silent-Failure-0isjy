This example demonstrates a subtle type mismatch error in Swift. The `calculateArea` function expects integer inputs for width and height. However, the code attempts to pass a string to the height parameter. While Swift's type system is robust, this kind of runtime type error can occur when dealing with dynamic data or when type safety is not thoroughly checked. The bug showcases a scenario where a runtime error can slip through because it involves a function call with a String that might be unexpectedly cast to an integer in some other languages.
